    <h3>I'm Samantha Grace M. Lofamia and you can call me, Sam. I've been doing some websites about myself, and my business. I enjoyed doing and designing my websites using HTML and CSS containing ANIMATION and GRID, although I had a hard time doing it because it is my first time. I will be delighted to share with you all my done websites. So, if you want to visit it you can click the navigation "Portfolio" placed above.</h3>
